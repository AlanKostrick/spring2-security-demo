## Spring 2 Security Demo 
In the process of taking a Spring 1.5 app that had working security and converting it to Spring 2. A few changes have been made. 

Login  name/password: admin/admin or user1/user1

currently glitchy. No css initially shows for login page. Once I submit the form it takes me to the css??? If I type url in browser such as localhost:8080/login a second time once logged in...all is well.
